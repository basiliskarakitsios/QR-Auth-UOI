# QR-Auth-UOI
QR Auth UOI is my thesis, for the University of Ioannina. It's a mobile app for a contactless identification of a user, designed for mobile devices with Android OS. I've completed the same app for iOS devices, but I haven't uploaded it. This app has been created using Android Studio. You can seek further details in Greek in "readme.pdf".
